                  a scientist at the University of Cambridge, King’s College
                  London and University College London. But one day he found
                  himself looking for a movie he wanted to watch… but which
                  didn’t exist. Very soon he discovered how important
                  filmmaking is to him, and how much impact it can have
                  on a person’s life. </p><p>Now he spends most of his time
                  writing, filming, editing and building Seven Hills into
                  a positive voice in the film industry. And he’s still
                  trying to make the movie that started it all.</p>

                     DP and editor, with clients as diverse as Arcade Fire,

                     he has pioneered 360 video and virtual reality content
                     creation via VRscape.tv. He is a firm believer in this
                     new art form and virtual reality’s ability to provoke
                      empathy in a much more genuine and direct way than

                       <p>Prior to filmmaking, he studied Archaeology at UCL
                         and has retained a great passion for all areas of

                        more House of Cards than The West Wing in the nation's
                         capital. After trying various nutty snacks in the

                          a bite out of the forbidden fruit of filmmaking.

                            banished him to a life of "artistry"; a dirty,
