            a scientist at the University of Cambridge, King’s College
            London and University College London. But one day he found
            himself looking for a movie he wanted to watch… but which
            didn’t exist. Very soon he discovered how important
            filmmaking is to him, and how much impact it can have
            on a person’s life. </p><p>Now he spends most of his time
              writing, filming, editing and building Seven Hills into
              a positive voice in the film industry. And he’s still
              trying to make the movie that started it all.</p>

                  wilderness of career indecision, he eventually took
                  a bite out of the forbidden fruit of filmmaking.
                  It was a delicious bite but it was also one that
                  banished him to a life of "artistry"; a dirty,
                  dirty word in the eyes of his family and the
                  Bangladeshi community of Queens, NY. But in the
